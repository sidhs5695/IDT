Hello,
Hope you are fine

This is a demo app to retrieve the location of the an ipaddress using the ipapi.co
To run this application, you need node.js environment installed. After installing node.js, 
extract the content to your desired location
open the terminal and set path to the desired location folder, and enter the command "npm start"
after this command, terminal will start the application.
To access the application- in your browser, type http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

Additional features- have used the maps api of google for marking the location of the api on the map. 
Feel free to mail me for the api key or use your own api key in the index.handlebars where I have defined the api.

Future work- Learning React.Js for enhancing the UI. Had almost finsihed implementing the AWS SNS notification. Will be implementing the AWS SNS thing as soon as possible after rectifying the errors.
